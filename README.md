## Hello World

I'm FIGBERT, an Israeli-American high school student with a passion for Computer
Science and Engineering. I spend my time coding side-projects, doing schoolwork,
and playing the occasional videogame. My current goal is to become a full-stack
developer, proficient in everything from front-end design to cybersecurity.

## My Work

- Read my writing [on this site][posts] or in the [Atom feed][atom].
- Download [txtodo][txtodo-site] from [the App Store][txtodo-store] and read
the [writeup][txtodo-article].
- Take a look at the [source code for this site][site-src]. It's all open
source!
- Check out my text adventure, [One Angry Wizard][txt-adventure].

I'm constantly working on more stuff, so continue checking back for more project
highlights.
